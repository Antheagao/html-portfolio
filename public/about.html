<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Riverside. 
    In March 2024 I graduated with my Master of science in Computer Science </p>

<p> I like anime and video games. My favorite Games to play are Genshin Impact,
    Honkai Impact, Honkai Star Rail, Zenless Zone Zero, and Wuthering Waves.
    I watch a wide variety of anime, but I mostly enjoy shonen and sci-fi </p>
